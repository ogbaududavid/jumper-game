# Overview
The game allowed me to explore concenpts and techniques in c# such as abstraction, object oriented programing, classes, methods, fields, access modifiers, reading and writing to the console, working with loops, conditions, and if statements.

Jumper is a word game where a radom word is generated from a list of words and a player is asked to guess the letters that makes
up the random word. When a player's guess is wrong, a part of their parachute is cut off; when the players guess is right, the parachute remains
intact and the letter is revealed in its correct position in the word. The aim of this game is to help improve spelling and literacy.
